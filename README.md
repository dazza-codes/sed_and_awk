The following applies to example files from material published by O’Reilly
Media, Inc. Content from other publishers may include different rules of
usage. Please refer to any additional usage rights explained in the actual
example files or refer to the publisher’s website.

O'Reilly books are here to help you get your job done. In general, you may
use the code in O'Reilly books in your programs and documentation. You do not
need to contact us for permission unless you're reproducing a significant
portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks
of code from our books does not require permission. Answering a question by
citing our books and quoting example code does not require permission. On the
other hand, selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books
does require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code
from our books into your product's documentation does require permission.

We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually
includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.

If you think your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the
permission given here, feel free to contact us at permissions@oreilly.com.
Please note that the examples are not production code and have not been
carefully testing. They are provided "as-is" and come with no warranty of any
kind.

### Note

O'Reilly granted permission to host example code in this repository,
see issue #1 for details.  The O'Reilly project code does not seem to
permit any forks or other routine github collaborations for issues and PRs.
